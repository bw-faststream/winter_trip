It’s that time of year when the leaves begin to fall and the nights are getting darker - so it’s the perfect time for a chilly autumn getaway to the country! Lets head off for a short weekend at Highfield cottage, Suffolk, for a brisk walk, cosy food and whatever fringe alcohol Greg can find in his cupboard. 

As much discussed on WhatsApp, invite to all of ex and new Greenaway, plus partners (and anyone else if they want to join. There are 4 double beds in the house, and a couch and some chairs that people can sleep on, but we can always squash more people onto the beds if needs. 

The train takes two hours from Liverpool street, and costs less than £50 return without a railcard (RIP Greg and Julie). We'll need to take a short taxi to the house, but it costs less than £10 per 6 person taxi. Highfield Cottage is deep in Suffolk farm country, so you'll need some walking boots or wellies for a walk to the sea and a pub lunch. 

We can all leave for the 7pm or 8pm train on Friday evening, to give us two nights in the cottage, but if you can't get out on Friday you can catch a train the next morning and meet us there. We'll need to bring all the food for the weekend with us, as its pretty far out rural.

Let me know if you'd like to invite anyone else, or if I've missed someone off the list.

	• New Hampshire Autumn
	• Turtlenecks and assorted knitwear
